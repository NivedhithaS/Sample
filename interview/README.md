Test Data for the Weather Prediction
========================

It is a package for generation the example data for weather prediction. It develop with java 1.7 on Eclipse with MacOs 10.10.x
A nested HashMap is used to store items in this model because the  time complexity for look up and insert a HashMap is O(1) if there is not a hash collision. The Arrays<> is good solution to replace this hashMap if the number of item is defined.

The algorithms in this application are reference some research papers in following
